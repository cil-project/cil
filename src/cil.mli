(** This module defines the abstract syntax of CIL. It also provides utility 
 * functions for traversing the CIL data structures, and pretty-printing 
 * them. The parser for both the GCC and MSVC front-ends can be invoked as 
 * [Frontc.parse: string -> unit ->] {!Cil.file}. This function must be given 
 * the name of a preprocessed C file and will return the top-level data 
 * structure that describes a whole source file. By default the parsing and 
 * elaboration into CIL is done as for GCC source. If you want to use MSVC 
 * source you must set the {!Cil.msvcMode} to [true] and must also invoke the 
 * function [Frontc.setMSVCMode: unit -> unit]. *)

 * {!Cil.file} using the following iterators: {!Cil.mapGlobals}, 
 * {!Cil.iterGlobals} and {!Cil.foldGlobals}. You can also use the 
 * {!Cil.dummyFile} when you need a {!Cil.file} as a placeholder. For each

        must be preceded in the file by a definition of the name. The string 
        is the defined name and always not-empty. *)

  | GCompTag of compinfo * location     
    (** Defines a struct/union tag with some fields. There must be one of 
        these for each struct/union tag that you use (through the [TComp] 
        constructor) since this is the only context in which the fields are 
        printed. Consequently nested structure tag definitions must be 
        broken into individual definitions with the innermost structure 
        defined first. *)

  | GCompTagDecl of compinfo * location
    (** Declares a struct/union tag. Use as a forward declaration. This is 
      * printed without the fields.  *)

  | GEnumTag of enuminfo * location
   (** Declares an enumeration tag with some fields. There must be one of 
      these for each enumeration tag that you use (through the [TEnum]

       forms appear then they must share the same varinfo structure. A 
       prototype shares the varinfo with the fundec of the definition. Either

     (** A variable definition. Can have an initializer. The initializer is 
      * updateable so that you can change it without requiring to recreate 
      * the list of globals. There can be at most one definition for a

      * type. Note: the initializer field is kept for backwards compatibility,
      * but it is now also available directly in the varinfo. *)

(** {b Types}. A C type is represented in CIL using the type {!Cil.typ}. 
 * Among types we differentiate the integral types (with different kinds 
 * denoting the sign and precision), floating point types, enumeration types, 
 * array and pointer types, and function types. Every type is associated with 
 * a list of attributes, which are always kept in sorted order. Use 
 * {!Cil.addAttribute} and {!Cil.addAttributes} to construct list of 
 * attributes. If you want to inspect a type, you should use 
 * {!Cil.unrollType} or {!Cil.unrollTypeDeep} to see through the uses of 
 * named types. *)
(** CIL is configured at build-time with the sizes and alignments of the 
 * underlying compiler (GCC or MSVC). CIL contains functions that can compute 
 * the size of a type (in bits) {!Cil.bitsSizeOf}, the alignment of a type 
 * (in bytes) {!Cil.alignOf_int}, and can convert an offset into a start and 
 * width (both in bits) using the function {!Cil.bitsOffset}. At the moment 
 * these functions do not take into account the [packed] attributes and 
 * pragmas. *)

and typ =

  | TInt of ikind * attributes 
     (** An integer type. The kind specifies the sign and width. Several

      * {!Cil.longType}, {!Cil.charType}. *)


  | TFloat of fkind * attributes 
     (** A floating-point type. The kind specifies the precision. You can 
      * also use the predefined constant {!Cil.doubleType}. *)

  | TPtr of typ * attributes  
           (** Pointer type. Several useful variants are predefined as 
            * {!Cil.charPtrType}, {!Cil.charConstPtrType} (pointer to a 
            * constant character), {!Cil.voidPtrType}, 
            * {!Cil.intPtrType}  *)

  | TArray of typ * exp option * attributes
           (** Array type. It indicates the base type and the array length. *)

  | TFun of typ * (string * typ * attributes) list option * bool * attributes
          (** Function type. Indicates the type of the result, the name, type 
           * and name attributes of the formal arguments ([None] if no 
           * arguments were specified, as in a function whose definition or 
           * prototype we have not seen; [Some \[\]] means void). Use 
           * {!Cil.argsToList} to obtain a list of arguments. The boolean 
           * indicates if it is a variable-argument function. If this is the 
           * type of a varinfo for which we have a function declaration then 
           * the information for the formals must match that in the 
           * function's sformals. Use {!Cil.setFormals}, or 
           * {!Cil.setFunctionType}, or {!Cil.makeFormalVar} for this 
           * purpose. *)

  | TNamed of typeinfo * attributes 
          (** The use of a named type. Each such type name must be preceded 
           * in the file by a [GType] global. This is printed as just the 
           * type name. The actual referred type is not printed here and is 
           * carried only to simplify processing. To see through a sequence 
           * of named type references, use {!Cil.unrollType} or 
           * {!Cil.unrollTypeDeep}. The attributes are in addition to those 
           * given when the type name was defined. *)

  | TComp of compinfo * attributes
(** The most delicate issue for C types is that recursion that is possible by 
 * using structures and pointers. To address this issue we have a more 
 * complex representation for structured types (struct and union). Each such 
 * type is represented using the {!Cil.compinfo} type. For each composite 
 * type the {!Cil.compinfo} structure must be declared at top level using 
 * [GCompTag] and all references to it must share the same copy of the 
 * structure. The attributes given are those pertaining to this use of the 
 * type and are in addition to the attributes that were given at the 
 * definition of the type and which are stored in the {!Cil.compinfo}. *)

  | TEnum of enuminfo * attributes
           (** A reference to an enumeration type. All such references must
               share the enuminfo among them and with a [GEnumTag] global that 
               precedes all uses. The attributes refer to this use of the 
               enumeration and are in addition to the attributes of the 
               enumeration itself, which are stored inside the enuminfo  *)

  
  | TBuiltin_va_list of attributes
            (** This is the same as the gcc's type with the same name *)

(**
 There are a number of functions for querying the kind of a type. These are
 {!Cil.isIntegralType}, 
 {!Cil.isArithmeticType}, 
 {!Cil.isPointerType}, 
 {!Cil.isScalarType}, 
 {!Cil.isFunctionType}, 
 {!Cil.isArrayType}. 

 There are two easy ways to scan a type. First, you can use the
{!Cil.existsType} to return a boolean answer about a type. This function
is controlled by a user-provided function that is queried for each type that is
used to construct the current type. The function can specify whether to
terminate the scan with a boolean result or to continue the scan for the
nested types. 

 The other method for scanning types is provided by the visitor interface (see
 {!Cil.cilVisitor}).

 If you want to compare types (or to use them as hash-values) then you should
use instead type signatures (represented as {!Cil.typsig}). These
contain the same information as types but canonicalized such that simple Ocaml
structural equality will tell whether two types are equal. Use
{!Cil.typeSig} to compute the signature of a type. If you want to ignore
certain type attributes then use {!Cil.typeSigWithAttrs}.

(** {b Variables.}

[GVar] or [GFun] globals. A local varinfo can be introduced as part of a
function definition {!Cil.fundec}. 

 All references to a given global or local variable must refer to the same
copy of the [varinfo]. Each [varinfo] has a globally unique identifier that 
can be used to index maps and hashtables (the name can also be used for this 
purpose, except for locals from different functions). This identifier is 
constructor using a global counter.

 It is very important that you construct [varinfo] structures using only one
 of the following functions:
- {!Cil.makeGlobalVar} : to make a global variable
- {!Cil.makeTempVar} : to make a temporary local variable whose name
will be generated so that to avoid conflict with other locals. 
- {!Cil.makeLocalVar} : like {!Cil.makeTempVar} but you can specify the
exact name to be used. 
- {!Cil.copyVarinfo}: make a shallow copy of a varinfo assigning a new name 
and a new unique identifier

 A [varinfo] is also used in a function type to denote the list of formals.

(** {b Expressions.} The CIL expression language contains only the side-effect free expressions of
C. They are represented as the type {!Cil.exp}. There are several
interesting aspects of CIL expressions: 

 Integer and floating point constants can carry their textual representation.
This way the integer 15 can be printed as 0xF if that is how it occurred in the
source. 

 CIL uses 64 bits to represent the integer constants and also stores the width
of the integer type. Care must be taken to ensure that the constant is
representable with the given width. Use the functions {!Cil.kinteger},
{!Cil.kinteger64} and {!Cil.integer} to construct constant
expressions. CIL predefines the constants {!Cil.zero},
{!Cil.one} and {!Cil.mone} (for -1). 

 Use the functions {!Cil.isConstant} and {!Cil.isInteger} to test if
an expression is a constant and a constant integer respectively.

 CIL keeps the type of all unary and binary expressions. You can think of that
type qualifying the operator. Furthermore there are different operators for
arithmetic and comparisons on arithmetic types and on pointers. 

 Another unusual aspect of CIL is that the implicit conversion between an
expression of array type and one of pointer type is made explicit, using the
[StartOf] expression constructor (which is not printed). If you apply the
[AddrOf}]constructor to an lvalue of type [T] then you will be getting an
expression of type [TPtr(T)].

 You can find the type of an expression with {!Cil.typeOf}. 

 You can perform constant folding on expressions using the function
{!Cil.constFold}.

                                         * set {!Cil.useLogicalOperators}. *)

(** {b Lvalues.} Lvalues are the sublanguage of expressions that can appear at the left of an assignment or as operand to the address-of operator. 
In C the syntax for lvalues is not always a good indication of the meaning 
of the lvalue. For example the C value
{v  
a[0][1][2]
 v}
 might involve 1, 2 or 3 memory reads when used in an expression context,
depending on the declared type of the variable [a]. If [a] has type [int
\[4\]\[4\]\[4\]] then we have one memory read from somewhere inside the area 
that stores the array [a]. On the other hand if [a] has type [int ***] then
the expression really means [* ( * ( * (a + 0) + 1) + 2)], in which case it is
clear that it involves three separate memory operations. 

An lvalue denotes the contents of a range of memory addresses. This range 
is denoted as a host object along with an offset within the object. The 
host object can be of two kinds: a local or global variable, or an object 
whose address is in a pointer expression. We distinguish the two cases so 
that we can tell quickly whether we are accessing some component of a 
variable directly or we are accessing a memory location through a pointer.
To make it easy to 
tell what an lvalue means CIL represents lvalues as a host object and an
offset (see {!Cil.lval}). The host object (represented as
{!Cil.lhost}) can be a local or global variable or can be the object
pointed-to by a pointer expression. The offset (represented as
{!Cil.offset}) is a sequence of field or array index designators.

 Both the typing rules and the meaning of an lvalue is very precisely
specified in CIL. 

 The following are a few useful function for operating on lvalues:
- {!Cil.mkMem} - makes an lvalue of [Mem] kind. Use this to ensure
that certain equivalent forms of lvalues are canonized. 
For example, [*&x = x]. 
- {!Cil.typeOfLval} - the type of an lvalue
- {!Cil.typeOffset} - the type of an offset, given the type of the
host. 
- {!Cil.addOffset} and {!Cil.addOffsetLval} - extend sequences
of offsets.
- {!Cil.removeOffset} and {!Cil.removeOffsetLval} - shrink sequences
of offsets.

The following equivalences hold {v 
Mem(AddrOf(Mem a, aoff)), off   = Mem a, aoff + off 
Mem(AddrOf(Var v, aoff)), off   = Var v, aoff + off 
AddrOf (Mem a, NoOffset)        = a                 
 v}

     * [TPtr(T)]. *)


(** The offset part of an {!Cil.lval}. Each offset can be applied to certain 
  * kinds of lvalues and its effect is that it advances the starting address 
  * of the lvalue and changes the denoted type, essentially focusing to some 
  * smaller lvalue that is contained in the original one. *)

                        * or as a terminator in a list of other kinds of 
                        * offsets. *)

                       * to be the type of the array element *)


(** {b Initializers.} A special kind of expressions are those that can appear 
 * as initializers for global variables (initialization of local variables is 
 * turned into assignments). The initializers are represented as type 
 * {!Cil.init}. You can create initializers with {!Cil.makeZeroInit} and you 
 * can conveniently scan compound initializers them with 
 * {!Cil.foldLeftCompound}. *)
(** Initializers for global variables. *)
and init = 
  | SingleInit   of exp   (** A single initializer *)
  | CompoundInit   of typ * (offset * init) list
    (** Used only for initializers of structures, unions and arrays. The 
     * offsets are all of the form [Field(f, NoOffset)] or [Index(i, 
     * NoOffset)] and specify the field or the index being initialized. For 
     * structures all fields must have an initializer (except the unnamed 
     * bitfields), in the proper order. This is necessary since the offsets 
     * are not printed. For unions there must be exactly one initializer. If 
     * the initializer is not for the first field then a field designator is 
     * printed, so you better be on GCC since MSVC does not understand this. 
     * For arrays, however, we allow you to give only a prefix of the 
     * initializers. You can scan an initializer list with 
     * {!Cil.foldLeftCompound}. *)

 * as a mutable field *)
and initinfo = {
    mutable init : init option;
  } 

(** {b Function definitions.} 
A function definition is always introduced with a [GFun] constructor at the
top level. All the information about the function is stored into a
{!Cil.fundec}. Some of the information (e.g. its name, type,
storage, attributes) is stored as a {!Cil.varinfo} that is a field of the
[fundec]. To refer to the function from the expression language you must use
the [varinfo]. 

 The function definition contains, in addition to the body, a list of all the
local variables and separately a list of the formals. Both kind of variables
can be referred to in the body of the function. The formals must also be shared
with the formals that appear in the function type. For that reason, to
manipulate formals you should use the provided functions
{!Cil.makeFormalVar} and {!Cil.setFormals} and {!Cil.makeFormalVar}. 
*)

(** {b Statements}. 
CIL statements are the structural elements that make the CFG. They are 
represented using the type {!Cil.stmt}. Every
statement has a (possibly empty) list of labels. The
{!Cil.stmtkind} field of a statement indicates what kind of statement it 
is.

 Use {!Cil.mkStmt} to make a statement and the fill-in the fields. 

CIL also comes with support for control-flow graphs. The [sid] field in
[stmt] can be used to give unique numbers to statements, and the [succs]
and [preds] fields can be used to maintain a list of successors and
predecessors for every statement. The CFG information is not computed by
default. Instead you must explicitly use the functions
{!Cil.prepareCFG} and {!Cil.computeCFGInfo} to do it.

where the parts are

  - [volatile] (optional): when present, the assembler instruction
    cannot be removed, moved, or otherwise optimized
  - template: a sequence of strings, with %0, %1, %2, etc. in the string to 
    refer to the input and output expressions. I think they're numbered
    consecutively, but the docs don't specify. Each string is printed on 
    a separate line. This is the only part that is present for MSVC inline
    assembly.
  - "ci" (oi): pairs of constraint-string and output-lval; the 
    constraint specifies that the register used must have some
    property, like being a floating-point register; the constraint
    string for outputs also has "=" to indicate it is written, or
    "+" to indicate it is both read and written; 'oi' is the
    name of a C lvalue (probably a variable name) to be used as
    the output destination
  - "dj" (ij): pairs of constraint and input expression; the constraint
    is similar to the "ci"s.  the 'ij' is an arbitrary C expression
    to be loaded into the corresponding register
  - "rk": registers to be regarded as "clobbered" by the instruction;
    "memory" may be specified for arbitrary memory effects

an example (from gcc manual):
{v 
  asm volatile ("movc3 %0,%1,%2"
                : /* no outputs */
                : "g" (from), "g" (to), "g" (count)
                : "r0", "r1", "r2", "r3", "r4", "r5");
 v}

 Starting with gcc 3.1, the operands may have names:

{v 
  asm volatile ("movc3 %[in0],%1,%2"
                : /* no outputs */
                : [in0] "g" (from), "g" (to), "g" (count)
                : "r0", "r1", "r2", "r3", "r4", "r5");

                        d_exp e loc.file loc.line)
 v}

 and here is an example of how you print a fatal error message that stop the 
* execution: {v 
Errormsg.s (Errormsg.bug "Why am I here?")
 v}

 Notice that you can use C format strings with some extension. The most 
useful extension is "%a" that means to consumer the next two argument from 
the argument list and to apply the first to [unit] and then to the second 
and to print the resulting {!Pretty.doc}. For each major type in CIL there is 
a corresponding function that pretty-prints an element of that type:
