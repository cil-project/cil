(* Generate LLVM code for a CIL file. This provides an alternate code generation
   path from CIL (vs the usual "regenerate and compile C code"), which gives more
   code generation flexibility (to the extent that LLVM is more flexible than C).

   The current implementation is targeted to x86 processors using gcc's C dialect.
   Supporting MSVC or other processors shouldn't require too much work - x86
   and gcc dependencies are marked with comments starting with X86: and GCC:
   respectively. We handle all of C, except:

     bitfields, shows up in:
     - field read/writes
     - structure declarations
     inline and module-level assembly

     gcc inline assembly

     gcc pragmas/attributes (those not handled by CIL directly)

     "align" directives:
     - need to output align on globals, alloca
     - should output align on load, store (note: already passed to llvm.memcpy)
     - need to ensure padding is added to structures that use the "aligned" attribute

     variable-size types, shows up in:
     - iExp: will just recurse indefinitely
     - iBinop/MinusPP: will get an exception when computing elemsize

let generate (f:file) : doc = 

  (* Implementation overview:
     - For all top-level declarations except function definitions, we directly
       generate a doc string representing the LLVM equivalent.
     - For functions, we use the llvmGeneratorClass to "compile" (but the
       transformation is very simple) CIL's intermediate code to LLVM code
       (see the llvm* types in llvmgen.ml) in non-SSA form. We then use
       llvmssa.ml to transform this code into SSA form, and finally print
       the results as a doc string.
     - We also use  llvmGeneratorClass to keep track of the string constants
       used in file 'f'. We need to print these as top-level LLVM constants
       (outside function bodies).
