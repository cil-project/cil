(************************************************************************
 * canonicalize performs several transformations to correct differences
 * between C and C++, so that the output is (hopefully) valid C++ code.
 * This is incomplete -- certain fixes which are necessary 
 * for some programs are not yet implemented.
 * 
 * #1) C allows global variables to have multiple declarations and multiple
 *     (equivalent) definitions. This transformation removes all but one
 *     declaration and all but one definition.
 *
 * #2) Any variables that use C++ keywords as identifiers are renamed.
 *
 * #3) __inline is #defined to inline, and __restrict is #defined to nothing.
 *
 * #4) C allows function pointers with no specified arguments to be used on
 *     any argument list.  To make C++ accept this code, we insert a cast
 *     from the function pointer to a type that matches the arguments.  Of
 *     course, this does nothing to guarantee that the pointer actually has
 *     that type.
 *
 * #5) Makes casts from int to enum types explicit.  (CIL changes enum
 *     constants to int constants, but doesn't use a cast.)
 *
