(************************************************************************
 * canonicalize performs several transformations to correct differences
 * between C and C++, so that the output is (hopefully) valid C++ code.
 * This is incomplete -- certain fixes which are necessary 
 * for some programs are not yet implemented.
 * 
 * See canonicalize.ml for a list of changes.
